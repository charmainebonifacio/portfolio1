#  Academic Portfolio

This is the repository of the website [charmainebonifacio.com](http://charmainebonifacio.com). It is hosted directly from the repository as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website, just like the original repository of the website [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com).

## Local Setup

GitHub Pages websites being served through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you will need to replicate the setup on your local machine to preview the website locally.

Please install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your system, if you don't have them already.

Once installed, `cd` to the respository directory and run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ jekyll s
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) on your browser.

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), read up the docs if you need to go beyond basic Markdown in the doc files.

To understand the template system used by Jekyll, read up the [Liquid template engine docs](http://liquidmarkup.org/).

## Why use Jekyll instead of an Express-based solution?

Jekyll comes built-in with GitHub Pages. Since we are already using GitHub Pages to host the website, it makes sense to leverage the capabilities it provides. It's all about using the right tool, for the right job, under the right circumstances.

## Contribution and Collaboration

Please feel free to make changes to the template files or the document files on the original respository and used it as your own as described in [ExpressJS ReadMe](https://github.com/strongloop/expressjs.com/blob/gh-pages/README.md) file. The supporting docs are located in their respective directories.
